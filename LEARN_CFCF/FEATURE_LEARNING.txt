To generate the dataset, one should follow the instructions below:
	(1) After signing up ILSVRC from "http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/signup", 
	download the full dataset (around 85GB).

	(2) Arrange the training part of the dataset as follows:
		YOURLOCAL/ILSVRC_VID/ILSVRC/Data/VID/train/ILSVRC2015_VID_train_0000;
		YOURLOCAL/ILSVRC_VID/ILSVRC/Data/VID/train/ILSVRC2015_VID_train_0001;
		YOURLOCAL/ILSVRC_VID/ILSVRC/Data/VID/train/ILSVRC2015_VID_train_0002;
		YOURLOCAL/ILSVRC_VID/ILSVRC/Data/VID/train/ILSVRC2015_VID_train_0003;

		YOURLOCAL/ILSVRC_VID/ILSVRC/Annotations/VID/train/ILSVRC2015_VID_train_0000/';
		YOURLOCAL/ILSVRC_VID/ILSVRC/Annotations/VID/train/ILSVRC2015_VID_train_0001/';
		YOURLOCAL/ILSVRC_VID/ILSVRC/Annotations/VID/train/ILSVRC2015_VID_train_0002/';
		YOURLOCAL/ILSVRC_VID/ILSVRC/Annotations/VID/train/ILSVRC2015_VID_train_0003/';

	(4) Create an output folder for the imdb files as IMDB_ILSVRC in the current directory for the next step.

	(5) Run generateIMDB_ILSVRC.m after arranging the paths as in the previous step.

To fine-tune the imagenet-vgg-m-2048 network, follow the instructions below:

	(1) Download the MatConvNet library from http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/
	We advise you to download 1.0-beta20 or 1.0-beta23 since the training of the network is verified in these versions.
	And additionally download the network model to be fine-tuned from "http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/"
	
	(2) Although we are using vl_simplenn2.m function to forward and backward propagate the data through the network, 
	one should double check the existence of possible version differences of functions regarding the layer type, such as vl_nnconv etc.

	(3) Go to your workspace where the folder includes the provided .m files. Create a folder named 'exp_vgg_finetuned'.
	Inside CFCF_train.m, replace your local path with YOURLOCAL and run DCFCF_VGG_Fine_Tuned.m to start training.
